## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

Ministry of Environment

## Idea
Responsibly Recycle tackles e-waste by connecting users with nearby collection points and educating them on the dangers of improper disposal.  Imagine a user-friendly website with a map guiding them to drop-off locations. Educational pop-ups highlight the harmful components in e-waste and their environmental consequences.  The platform adds a twist with a reward system! Users can enter their old device model to estimate points based on recoverable precious metals, motivating them to recycle responsibly. This comprehensive approach empowers users and promotes a greener future.


## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
The proposed solution for Responsibly Recycle is a three-pronged attack on e-waste. First, a user-friendly website with a dynamic map will pinpoint the closest e-waste collection facilities. Second, educational pop-ups will act as digital guardians, informing users about the hazardous components in e-waste and the environmental repercussions of improper disposal. Finally, to gamify the process and incentivize responsible recycling, a reward system kicks in. Users can input their old device's model to estimate points based on the potential amount of recoverable precious metals, creating a win-win for both the environment and the user. This intricate web of features empowers users with knowledge and rewards them for taking action.
The platform will consist of three main components:

Frontend: A user-friendly website with an interactive map to locate nearby e-waste collection points.
Backend: A server-side application that manages user accounts, location data, educational content, and the reward system.
Database: Stores user information, collection facility locations, educational content, and user points.
